/*
 * Abstract builder/updater class for bottom-level accelerations structures (BLASs) top-level
 * accelerations structures (TLASs) and for ray-tracing.
 *
 * BLASs hold the geometry, while top-level accelerations structures instances bottom-level as using
 * transformation matrices.
 *
 * This builder holds a scratch buffer that is large enough for the largest AS.
 * The scratch buffer can be released by calling release(). This class must kept alive until the
 * build has finished.
 *
 * Best practices: (from
 * https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/best-practices-using-nvidia-rtx-ray-tracing/)
 *
 * For TLAS, consider the PREFER_FAST_TRACE flag and perform only rebuilds.
 * Often, this results in best overall performance.
 * The rationale is that making the TLAS as high quality as possible regardless of the movement
 * occurring in the scene is important and doesnâ€™t cost too much.
 *
 * For static BLASes, use the PREFER_FAST_TRACE flag.
 * For all BLASes that are built only one time, optimizing for best ray-trace performance is an easy
 * choice.
 *
 * For dynamic BLASes, choose between using the PREFER_FAST_TRACE or PREFER_FAST_BUILD flags, or
 * neither. For BLASes that are occasionally rebuilt or updated, the optimal build preference flag
 * depends on many factors. How much is built? How expensive are the ray traces? Can the build cost
 * be hidden by executing builds on async compute? To find the optimal solution for a specific case,
 * I recommend trying out different options.
 *
 * Note: You cannot use one builder for multiple frames in flight, because the scratch buffer might
 * be reallocated!
