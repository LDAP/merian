A generator node that outputs a solid color.
The image output is persistent since it will never change and this way the image has to be transferred only in build.

Outputs:

| Type  | Output ID | Output name | Description         | Format/Resolution | Persistent |
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Image | 0         | output      | the loaded image    | user defined      | yes        |
