A generator node that outputs a solid color.
The image output is persistent since it will never change and this way the image has to be transferred only in build.

Outputs:

| Type  | Output name | Description                             | Format/Resolution | Persistent |
|-------|-------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Image | out         | An image with the user defined color    | user defined      | yes        |
