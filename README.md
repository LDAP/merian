# Merian ðŸŽ¨

~ _A *Vulkan 1.3* prototyping framework._ ~


## Usage

This library uses the [Meson Build System](https://mesonbuild.com/) and declares a dependency for it:

``` 
# in your meson.build

merian = dependency('merian', fallback: ['merian', 'merian_dep'])
exe = executable(
    'my-app',
    dependencies: [
        merian,
    ],
    // ...
)
```

The `Context` class initializes and destroys a Vulkan device and holds core objects (PhysicalDevice, Device, Queues, ...).

Create a Context using the `Context::make_context(..)` method.

For common Vulkan objects a wrapper is provided that holds a shared pointer on its parent.
This is to ensure that dependent objects (Command Buffer â†’ Pool â†’ Device) are destructed in the right order automagically.
You should never need to call `destroy()` or `free()` manually.
Keep in mind to keep a reference to the shared pointers to prevent frequent object construction and destruction.
Whenever you create objects by yourself you should consider using `make_shared<Class>(..)`.
If a `std::bad_weak_ptr` is thrown you should have used `make_shared<>(...)` instead of creating the object directly.

Make sure your program ends with `[INFO] [context.cpp:XX] context destroyed`.

Note that the Vulkan dynamic dispatch loader must be used. The default dispatcher is initialized in `Context`.

```c++
#define VULKAN_HPP_DISPATCH_LOADER_DYNAMIC 1
```

## Getting started

```c++
int main() {
    merian::ExtensionVkDebugUtils debugUtils;
    merian::ExtensionResources resources;
    std::vector<merian::Extension*> extensions = {&debugUtils, &resources};

    merian::SharedContext context = merian::Context::make_context(extensions, "My beautiful app");
    auto alloc = resources.resource_allocator();

    // allocating, rendering,...

    // merian cleans up everything for you
}    
```

### Lifetime of objects

Design decisions:

- Functions that don't impact an object's lifetime (i.e. the object remains valid for the duration of the function) should take a plain reference or pointer, e.g. `int foo(bar& b)`.
- Functions that consume an object (i.e. are the final users of a given object) should take a `unique_ptr` by value, e.g. `int foo(unique_ptr<bar> b)`. Callers should std::move the value into the function.
- Functions that extend the lifetime of an object should take a `shared_ptr` by value, e.g. `int foo(shared_ptr<bar> b)`. The usual advice to avoid circular references applies. This does the heavy lifting of destroying objects in the right order.
- For Vulkan objects with lifetime a wrapper is provided that destroys the Vulkan object in its destructor.
  These object should derive from `std::enable_shared_from_this`.
